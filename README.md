# Visual Guides for Causal Inference

A collection of visual guides designed to help applied scientists learn causal inference.

Current guides include:

1. [Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE)](visual-guides/TMLE.pdf) for a binary outcome and binary treatment. 

2. [Superlearning](visual-guides/SL.pdf) (also known as stacking), an ensemble learning method recommended to use with TMLE.
